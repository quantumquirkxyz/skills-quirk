## Contract

- **Input:** system description, applicable frameworks, existing policies and evidence.
- **Output:** gap analysis + evidence pack + remediation roadmap + control matrix.
- **Side effects:** none (assessment only; does not implement fixes or certify compliance).
- **Dependencies:** access to systems, policies, logs, and stakeholders for evidence gathering.
- **Stop condition:** all applicable controls mapped; gaps documented with remediation steps; evidence catalogued.
- **Risk:** medium — compliance findings may have legal, regulatory, and reputational consequences; requires expert validation before certification.
- **Boundary:** assesses readiness and documents evidence; does not perform certification or legal attestation.

# Compliance

Assess **compliance posture** across SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS — with explicit control mapping, evidence collection, gap analysis, and remediation planning.

## Process

### 1. Frameworks and scope
- Which frameworks apply? (SOC2 Type I/II, ISO27001:2022, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS v4.0)
- What is in scope? (systems, data types, cloud regions, subsidiaries, vendors)
- What is out of scope? (non-regulated products, legacy systems being decommissioned)

**Completion criterion:** scope and framework list saved.

### 2. Control mapping
Map each framework's required controls to current controls:
- SOC2: CC1–CC7 (Control Environment through Encryption, Incident Response)
- ISO27001: Annex A controls (A.5–A.8: organisational, people, physical, technological)
- GDPR: Art. 5 (principles), Art. 24 (responsibility), Art. 32 (security of processing), Art. 33–34 (breach notification)
- HIPAA: Administrative (Security Rule), Physical, Technical safeguards
- PCI DSS: 12 requirements (build/maintain secure network, protect cardholder data, vulnerability management, access control, monitoring, testing)

**Completion criterion:** control matrix (framework control → current control → status) saved.

### 3. Evidence collection
For each control, collect evidence:
- Policies and procedures (approved, reviewed, versioned)
- Configuration snapshots (encryption settings, access controls, network segmentation)
- Logs (access, authentication, change, audit)
- Process records (onboarding/offboarding, vendor reviews, risk assessments, training)
- Test results (vulnerability scans, penetration tests, DR drills)
- Third-party attestations (vendor SOC2, BAA, DPA)

**Completion criterion:** evidence indexed by control; gaps in evidence flagged.

### 4. Gap analysis
For each control:
- **Present:** control exists, evidence is sufficient → pass.
- **Partial:** control exists but evidence is incomplete or implementation is inconsistent → partial.
- **Missing:** no control or no evidence → gap.

For each gap: root cause (no policy, no enforcement, no evidence), risk (likelihood × impact), and regulatory consequence (fine, certification loss, audit finding).

**Completion criterion:** gap register with severity and regulatory impact saved.

### 5. Remediation planning
For each gap:
- Remediation action (policy, tool, process, training)
- Owner (team or individual)
- Effort (low / medium / high)
- Timeline (sprint, quarter)
- Verification method (re-audit, scan, attestation, self-assessment)
- Dependencies (budget, vendor, legal review)

Prioritise by: regulatory deadline × risk × effort. Quick wins first (high impact, low effort).

**Completion criterion:** remediation roadmap with owners and milestones saved.

### 6. Continuous compliance
Design ongoing monitoring:
- Automated checks (configuration drift, policy violations, unpatched CVEs)
- Periodic evidence refresh (quarterly access reviews, annual policy review)
- Change management (new services assessed before production)
- Incident response integration (breach timelines aligned with notification requirements)
- Training and awareness cadence

**Completion criterion:** continuous compliance plan saved.

### 7. Audit readiness package
Assemble final package:
- Executive summary (posture, critical gaps, timeline to readiness)
- Control matrix with evidence links
- Gap register with remediation status
- Policies and procedures repository
- Evidence pack (organised by framework and control)
- Open items and escalation paths

**Completion criterion:** audit-ready package saved and reviewed.

## Rules

- Rule: map every control to a specific piece of evidence; do not accept verbal assurances as evidence.
- Rule: treat evidence as immutable once collected; version and timestamp all artifacts.
- Rule: classify gaps by regulatory severity (reportable vs. internal) and timeline (immediate vs. planned).
- Rule: assign a single owner to every remediation item; no unowned items in the roadmap.
- Rule: separate "control exists but undocumented" from "control does not exist" — they require different remediation.
- Rule: verify remediation effectiveness with objective evidence (re-scan, re-test, re-attest), not self-declaration alone.
