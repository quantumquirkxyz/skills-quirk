## Contract

- Input: Next.js brief, route map, and rendering constraints.
- Output: a Next.js seam proposal, route guidance, and server/client split guidance.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: documented standards override defaults; explicit project rules take precedence.
- Rule: if blocked by missing context or dependencies, surface the blocker before proceeding.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, artifact saved, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Emit `NextjsArtifact` as both:
- JSON: `.agents/skills/platform/artifacts/nextjs/{identifier}.json`
- Markdown view: same filename with `.md` extension


# 
# 
# Next.js

Use this skill when the project is built on Next.js and the route tree or rendering model needs to be shaped with intent. Keep the route surface small, the server/client split explicit, and the data flow easy to reason about.


## Steps

1. Identify the primary user path and route shape.
2. Decide the server/client split at the seam.
3. Note any data-fetching or rendering constraints.
4. Describe the smallest route structure that still fits the flow.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the artifact is saved and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
