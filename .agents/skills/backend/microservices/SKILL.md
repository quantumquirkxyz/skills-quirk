## Contract

- Input: skill invocation with the user's request and available context.
- Output: a structured artifact or guidance aligned to the skill's declared outputs.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: documented standards override defaults; explicit project rules take precedence.
- Rule: if blocked by missing context or dependencies, surface the blocker before proceeding.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, artifact saved, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Emit `MicroservicesArtifact` as both:
- JSON: `.agents/skills/platform/artifacts/microservices/{identifier}.json`
- Markdown view: same filename with `.md` extension

Design microservice architectures — service decomposition, inter-service communication, data ownership, resilience patterns — with explicit boundaries and failure isolation.

## Goals
- Decompose monoliths into bounded services
- Define clear ownership of data and behavior
- Plan synchronous and asynchronous communication
- Design for resilience and observability


## Steps

1. **Map the domain** — identify bounded contexts and aggregates
2. **Define service boundaries** — single responsibility, high cohesion
3. **Assign data ownership** — which service owns which data
4. **Choose communication style** — REST, gRPC, message queue, event bus
5. **Design resilience** — timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, bulkheads
6. **Plan observability** — distributed tracing, centralized logging

## Rules

- Rule: do not split a service without a clear ownership, scaling, deployment, or team-boundary reason.
- Rule: assign exactly one owner for each source of truth.
- Rule: prefer asynchronous communication only when eventual consistency is acceptable and observable.
- Rule: include timeout, retry, idempotency, and circuit-breaker behavior for every cross-service call.
- Rule: account for distributed tracing, correlation IDs, and operational ownership from the start.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the artifact is saved and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
