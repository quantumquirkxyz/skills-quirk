# Professional Market Research

Conduct **market analysis** — TAM/SAM/SOM, competitor mapping, pricing analysis, trend forecasting — with explicit sources and data quality checks.

## When to use
- The user needs market sizing for a business plan.
- A competitive landscape needs mapping.
- A pricing or go-to-market strategy needs data.

## Process
1. Scope — market definition, geography, time horizon.
2. TAM / SAM / SOM — total, serviceable, obtainable; justify with data sources.
3. Competitors — direct / indirect / substitutes; mapping with positioning and pricing.
4. Pricing — price points, cost structure, willingness-to-pay signals.
5. Trends — technology, regulation, demographic, macroeconomic; sources (reports, news, data APIs).
6. Data quality — primary vs secondary; date; bias; missing data acknowledged.
7. Deliver — Markdown report with sections, source citations, and a recommendation (enter / niche / avoid / watch).
