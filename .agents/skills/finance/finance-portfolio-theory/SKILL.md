# Portfolio Theory

Apply **Modern Portfolio Theory** — efficient frontier, CAPM, APT, performance attribution — with explicit assumptions and regime analysis.

## When to use

- The user wants to understand portfolio construction theory.
- CAPM / factor models are used for expected returns or risk attribution.
- Performance attribution or benchmark comparison is needed.

## Process

1. Define universe — assets, time window, currency.
2. Compute moments — expected returns (historical, factor, or blended), covariance matrix (shrinkage justified), correlations.
3. Efficient frontier — compute frontier; identify minimum-variance portfolio, tangency portfolio, and efficient set.
4. CAPM / APT — estimate beta for each asset; APT: factor exposures (Fama-French 3/5, momentum, quality).
5. Performance attribution — Brinson-Hood-Beebower: allocation, selection, interaction effects.
6. Regime analysis — does the factor model / efficient frontier hold across economic regimes?
7. Deliver — artifact: efficient frontier, CAPM betas / APT factor exposures, attribution decomposition, and a note on model assumptions and regime robustness.

## Rules

- Rule: state that outputs are analytical and not personalized financial advice.
- Rule: define universe, benchmark, horizon, currency, and rebalancing assumptions before optimizing.
- Rule: treat expected return estimates as fragile and show sensitivity to assumptions.
- Rule: check covariance stability, concentration, turnover, and transaction-cost impact.
- Rule: distinguish ex ante risk modeling from realized performance attribution.
