## Contract

- Input: docs brief, repository context, and change scope.
- Output: docs guidance, ADR guidance, and context coherence notes.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: documented standards override defaults; explicit project rules take precedence.
- Rule: if blocked by missing context or dependencies, surface the blocker before proceeding.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, artifact saved, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Emit `DocsManagementArtifact` as both:
- JSON: `.agents/skills/platform/artifacts/docs-management/{identifier}.json`
- Markdown view: same filename with `.md` extension


# 
# 
# Docs Management

Use this skill when the repository needs durable documentation discipline: what belongs in `CONTEXT.md`, when to write an ADR, and how to keep docs from drifting away from the code.


## Steps

1. Identify which durable docs are affected by the change.
2. Decide whether the change is glossary material, an ADR, or operational guidance.
3. Note what needs to stay coherent across future changes.
4. Flag any stale or contradictory material that should be removed or revised.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the artifact is saved and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
