# NoSQL Data Modeling

Design a **NoSQL data model** — document, key-value, wide-column, graph, time-series — with access pattern analysis and consistency trade-offs.

## When to use

- A domain naturally fits a NoSQL store (events, social graph, time-series, cache).
- Relational schema has been over-normalised for the read/write pattern.
- Scalability requirements push past a single RDBMS instance.

## Process

1. Identify access patterns — reads (by key, range, full-text, graph traversal) and writes (append, upsert, batch); frequency and latency requirements.
2. Choose NoSQL type:
   - Document (MongoDB, Couchbase): nested JSON, flexible schema.
   - Key-value (Redis, DynamoDB): simple get/put by key.
   - Wide-column (Cassandra, ScyllaDB): time-series, high-write throughput.
   - Graph (Neo4j, DynamoDB GSI): many-to-many, traversals.
   - Time-series (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB): metric ingestion, downsampling.
3. Design data layout — document structure, key design (partition + sort), column families, graph topology.
4. Consistency model — strong vs eventual; how does this affect correctness of reads?
5. Schema evolution — how are new fields / relationships added without downtime?
6. Scalability — partition/shard key; replication factor; read replicas; hot-key mitigation; backup and restore behavior.
7. Deliver — artifact with access patterns, selected store type, data layout, consistency model, schema evolution plan, and scaling risks.

## Rules

- Rule: design from access patterns before choosing a NoSQL product.
- Rule: state partition keys, sort keys, document boundaries, or graph traversal anchors explicitly.
- Rule: account for consistency, conflict resolution, and read-your-writes expectations.
- Rule: plan schema evolution and backfill paths for existing records.
- Rule: identify hot partitions, fan-out, and query patterns that the model cannot serve.
