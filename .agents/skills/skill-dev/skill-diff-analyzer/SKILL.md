## Contract

- **Input:** problem or task defined by the skill body.
- **Output:** Markdown artifact or structured result with completion criteria met.
- **Side effects:** none (design/review/documentation only unless explicitly stated).

- **Stop condition:** all process steps completed; artifact saved; criteria checked.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** produces reasoning or documentation artifacts; does not modify external systems unless explicitly instructed.


# Skill Diff Analyzer

## Contract

- Input: two readable `SKILL.md` files.
- Output: frontmatter changes, content additions/removals, dependency impact, and review recommendation.
- Boundary: compare files without editing either version.

Run `node .agents/skills/platform/skill-lab.mjs diff <old>/SKILL.md <new>/SKILL.md`. Treat changes to dependencies, side effects, or risk as review-required, and inspect additions/removals for accidental contract drift.
