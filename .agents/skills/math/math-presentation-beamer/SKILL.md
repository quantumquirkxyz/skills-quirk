## Contract

- **Input:** talk content (topic, audience, duration), and any figures.
- **Output:** Beamer source + speaker notes + accessibility checklist.
- **Side effects:** none.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Stop condition:** source compiles with figures and notes.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** produces presentation artifacts; does not deliver the talk.

# Math Presentation — Beamer and Design

Build a **Beamer presentation** that communicates the mathematics clearly to the audience, with accessible design and speaker-ready notes.

## When to use

- A seminar, conference talk, or lecture needs a structured slide set.
- Figures need to be accurate, consistent, and accessible.
- The speaker wants timing and transition notes.

## Process

### 1. Define the audience and duration

- **Audience level** — general mathematician / specialist / student / public.
- **Duration** — 15 min / 30 min / 50 min / 90 min.
- **Goal** — inform / persuade / teach / review.

**Completion criterion:** audience and goal explicit.

### 2. Structure the slides

- **Title + outline** (first 2 minutes).
- **Motivation / context** (why does this matter to this audience?).
- **Statement / result** (clear, with hypotheses).
- **Proof / construction** (key steps, with citations).
- **Application / consequence** (what changes now?).
- **References / acknowledgements.**

**Completion criterion:** structure saved; each section has a clear purpose.

### 3. Figures and diagrams

- Use TikZ for mathematical figures; keep style consistent.
- Colour: avoid colour-only signalling; use patterns / shapes.
- Font size: readable from the back of the room (min 16pt for body, 20pt for headings).
- Alt-text for each figure (description for screen readers).

**Completion criterion:** all figures have alt-text; colour accessibility checked.

### 4. Speaker notes

For each slide, write:

- **Key message** in 1 sentence.
- **Timing target** (e.g. "2 minutes").
- **Transition cue** ("Next: we show the main theorem...").
- **Common question / answer** (if this slide confuses someone).

**Completion criterion:** notes saved for each slide.

### 5. Compile and check

- Compile the `.tex`; fix errors.
- Print / preview; verify that no content overflows.
- Check timing by reading aloud (target pace: ~2 minutes per major slide).

**Completion criterion:** compiled PDF; timing verified; overflow checked.

## Notes

- Pair with `math-paper-collaboration` for sharing .tex source.
- Use `math-formal-proof` for appendix slides that cite a verified proof.
