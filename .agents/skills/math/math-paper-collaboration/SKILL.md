description: Manage mathematical paper collaboration — Overleaf / GitHub / arXiv integration, citation tracking, version control, reproducible computation links, and co-author coordination.
capabilities:
  - set up a shared repository (Overleaf or GitHub) for a paper
  - manage citation database (BibTeX / Zotero / Mendeley) with collaboration rules
  - link reproducible computation artifacts (see math-computation-reproducible)
  - coordinate co-author edits, comments, revisions, and arXiv submission
outputs:
  - Shared source repository (Git tag per version) with citation database
  - Collaboration rules document (who edits what, review cycle)
  - ArXiv submission package (source + compiled PDF + metadata)

## Contract

- **Input:** paper title, co-authors, citation database, computation artifacts.
- **Output:** shared repo + collaboration rules + arXiv package.
- **Side effects:** none.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Stop condition:** repository tagged; rules saved; package complete.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** manages collaboration artifacts; does not write the mathematics.

# Math Paper Collaboration

Coordinate a **mathematical paper** from first draft to arXiv submission — with version control, citation tracking, reproducible computation links, and co-author rules.

## When to use

- A paper has multiple co-authors.
- A paper needs a reproducible computation appendix.
- A paper needs to be submitted to arXiv with clean source.

## Process

### 1. Set up the repository

Choose:

- **Overleaf** — for LaTeX users who prefer an integrated editor; share link.
- **GitHub + Overleaf sync** — for version control + easy collaboration.
- **Git + arXiv source** — for full reproducibility; push source + compiled PDF.

Create:

- `main.tex`, `references.bib`, `styles/`.
- `reproducibility/` folder linking to computation artifacts (see `math-computation-reproducible`).

**Completion criterion:** repository initialised; co-authors have access.

### 2. Citation database

- Maintain a single `.bib` file; no duplicate keys.
- Use `bibtex` or `biber`; declare a style (`amsplain`, `alpha`, etc.).
- Track sources: each entry links to a source (arXiv, journal, book).
- For each citation in the paper, confirm it supports the claim (not just nearby in text).

**Completion criterion:** `.bib` clean; citations verified.

### 3. Collaboration rules

Document (e.g. `COLLABORATION.md`):

- **Who writes which section** — by name / role.
- **Review cycle** — who reads which version; how comments are tracked.
- **Merge rules** — how edits are integrated (pull request / Overleaf track changes).
- **Version tags** — `v0.1` (draft), `v1.0` (submission), `v1.1` (revision).
- **Authorship order** — confirmed by all co-authors.

**Completion criterion:** rules file saved and acknowledged by co-authors.

### 4. Reproducibility links

Link to computation artifacts:

- Git tag / DOI for the computation.
- Container image hash.
- Manifest file.

In the paper appendix, cite the computation: "Verified with SymPy 1.13; see repository [DOI] for code, container, and manifest."

**Completion criterion:** links present; reproducibility statement in appendix.

### 5. ArXiv package

Prepare:

- Source `.tex` + `.bib` + `.sty`.
- Figures (`.tikz`, `.pdf`).
- Compiled `.pdf`.
- Metadata (`title.tex`, `abstract.tex`).
- `README.md` describing the structure.

**Completion criterion:** package complete; arXiv upload possible.

## Notes

- Pair with `math-computation-reproducible` for the computation appendix.
- Pair with `math-formal-proof` for a formal proof appendix.
- For co-authors using different tools, agree on `.bib` format early.
