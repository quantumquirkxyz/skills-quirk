# Cryptographic Analysis

Analyse or design a **cryptographic construction** with explicit hardness assumptions, security reductions, and attack analysis.

## When to use

- The user wants a cryptographic protocol reviewed or designed.
- A security-critical component needs formal analysis.
- Key exchange, signatures, MACs, encryption, or ZK proofs are involved.

## Process

1. Identify the primitive type — symmetric encryption (block ciphers, stream ciphers), asymmetric (RSA, ECC, lattice-based), hash (collision-resistant, preimage), MAC / HMAC, signatures, key exchange, ZK proofs.
2. State hardness assumptions — DLP, CDH, DDH, RSA,factoring, LWE, SIS; quantify security level in bits.
3. Security goal — IND-CPA, IND-CCA, EUF-CMA, collision resistance, etc.
4. Attack analysis — birthday (hash), meet-in-the-middle, side-channel, replay, forward secrecy, oracle attacks.
5. Protocol design — if designing: use a well-known construction; do not invent primitives. Specify parties, messages, randomness sources, and secrets.
6. Deliver — artifact: primitive, hardness assumption, security goal, attack surface, and a security verdict (strong / moderate / weak / broken).

## Rules

- Rule: prefer standard, reviewed constructions over invented primitives.
- Rule: state security goals and attacker capabilities before evaluating a scheme.
- Rule: name hardness assumptions and estimated security level.
- Rule: include randomness, key management, side-channel, and replay considerations.
- Rule: mark any informal proof or missing reduction as a limitation.
