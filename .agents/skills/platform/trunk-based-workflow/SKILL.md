# Trunk-Based Workflow

Use this skill when the project needs to enforce trunk-based development discipline. It validates that every change follows short-lived branch and small PR rules before merge, emits a structured artifact, and records completion evidence.

## Contract

- Input: repository state, branch metadata (age, changed lines), CI status, merge strategy preference.
- Output: TrunkBasedWorkflowArtifact — a structured plan capturing validation results, decisions, and completion status.
- Scope: enforce workflow rules; not responsible for writing application code.
- Rule: every feature branch must be shorter than 24 hours old at merge time.
- Rule: every PR must be 400 lines changed or fewer.
- Rule: CI must be green before merge; no exceptions without explicit approval.
- Rule: merge strategy is either squash or merge-commit; never rebase after review.
- Rule: branch must be deleted after successful merge to keep trunk clean.
- Rule: violations must be recorded in the artifact with severity and remediation.

## Process

### Step 1: Validate branch age (< 24h)

- Inspect the feature branch creation timestamp against the current time.
- Compute age in hours.
- Pass if age < 24 hours. Fail if age >= 24 hours and record a violation.

**Completion criterion:** branch age is known and classified as passing or failing.

### Step 2: Validate PR size (max 400 lines changed)

- Count total lines changed in the PR (additions + deletions).
- Pass if lines changed <= 400. Fail if > 400 and record a violation.

**Completion criterion:** PR line count is known and classified as passing or failing.

### Step 3: Enforce CI green before merge

- Check the latest CI run status for the PR.
- Pass if status is green. Flag as pending if still running. Fail if red.

**Completion criterion:** CI status is confirmed green (or pending/failing with explicit approval noted).

### Step 4: Merge strategy (squash or merge-commit)

- Select merge strategy: `squash` (default, preferred for clean history) or `merge-commit` (preserves full branch history).
- Record the chosen strategy and rationale in the artifact.

**Completion criterion:** merge strategy is explicitly recorded.

### Step 5: Delete branch after merge

- Confirm branch deletion will occur after successful merge.
- Record cleanup intent in the artifact.

**Completion criterion:** cleanup plan is confirmed.

## Completion criteria

- branch age validated against < 24h threshold
- PR size validated against <= 400 lines changed
- CI green status confirmed
- merge strategy explicitly recorded
- branch cleanup planned and recorded
- TrunkBasedWorkflowArtifact emitted as JSON and Markdown
