## Contract

- **Input:** problem or task defined by the skill body.
- **Output:** Markdown artifact or structured result with completion criteria met.
- **Side effects:** none (design/review/documentation only unless explicitly stated).
- **Dependencies:** none (self-contained unless linked to other skills).
- **Stop condition:** all process steps completed; artifact saved; criteria checked.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** produces reasoning or documentation artifacts; does not modify external systems unless explicitly instructed.


# Artifact Handoff

Use this skill to move a result from one Skill to another without flattening it into prose.

## Steps

1. Package the artifact with id, type, producer, status, summary, evidence, and consumers.
2. Include the minimal context pointer required by the consumer.
3. Preserve provenance and redaction by default.

## Completion criteria

- the artifact validates against the shared envelope
- the next consumer is explicit
