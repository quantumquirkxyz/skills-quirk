# Grill

Run the `grilling` primitive as the stable quirk entrypoint named `grill`.

Use this alias when the user asks for `grill` specifically. Keep the behavior identical to `grilling`: ask one question at a time, recommend an answer for each question, inspect discoverable facts directly, and do not act on the plan until the user confirms the shared understanding is complete.
