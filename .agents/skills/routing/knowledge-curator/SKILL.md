# Knowledge Curator

Use this skill to curate durable knowledge after a run.

## Contract

- Input: candidate updates, existing context, and ADRs.
- Output: the minimal durable update that preserves consistency.
- Scope: curate durable knowledge, not implementation work.
- Rule: reject stale, duplicate, or contradictory material unless it is explicitly resolved.
- Rule: write only what should survive the current session.

## Steps

1. Compare candidate updates against existing context and ADRs.
2. Resolve contradictions or mark them for review.
3. Write only the minimal durable update needed.

## Completion criteria

- the durable knowledge set is consistent
- stale or duplicate material is rejected or merged
- the update is minimal and durable
- any contradiction is either resolved or flagged for review
