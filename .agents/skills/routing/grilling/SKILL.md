## Contract

- Input: skill invocation with the user's request and available context.
- Output: a structured artifact or guidance aligned to the skill's declared outputs.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: follow the skill's completion criteria and stop condition exactly.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, artifact saved, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Emit `GrillingArtifact` as both:
- JSON: `.agents/skills/platform/artifacts/grilling/{identifier}.json`
- Markdown view: same filename with `.md` extension


## 
## 
## Rules

- Rule: ask exactly one main question at a time.
- Rule: provide a recommended answer with each question so the user has a concrete foil.
- Rule: investigate discoverable facts directly before asking the user.
- Rule: keep decisions with the user, even when facts are discoverable.
- Rule: stop grilling when the plan is coherent enough to act or when a blocker requires outside input.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the artifact is saved and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
