## Contract

- Input: skill invocation with the user's request and available context.
- Output: a structured artifact or guidance aligned to the skill's declared outputs.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: documented standards override defaults; explicit project rules take precedence.
- Rule: if blocked by missing context or dependencies, surface the blocker before proceeding.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, structured result returned, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Return `ContextPackArtifact` as structured output in the current response. Do not write local artifact files unless the user explicitly asks for an export.


# 
# 
# Context Pack

Use this skill to select the minimum repo context needed for a task.


## Steps

1. Identify the task scope and the smallest authoritative docs needed.
2. Order the reads from durable repo context to task-specific evidence.
3. Record freshness, provenance, and budget in the pack.
4. Capture the smallest set of facts needed to choose the next skill without reopening the full repo.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the structured result is returned and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
