## Contract

- Input: web app surface, behavior under test, and test stack.
- Output: a test seam recommendation, verification plan, and coverage boundaries.
- Scope: stay within the skill's declared boundaries; do not broaden without explicit direction.
- Rule: documented standards override defaults; explicit project rules take precedence.
- Rule: if blocked by missing context or dependencies, surface the blocker before proceeding.

## Provenance

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What is the source of truth? | The user's request, originating spec/issue, and the skill's declared outputs |
| What is in scope? | Work covered by the skill's acceptance criteria and completion rules |
| What is explicitly out of scope? | Files, behaviors, and decisions outside the skill's declared boundary |
| Who or what consumes this artifact afterward? | The next skill in the workflow or the user |
| What evidence proves it is done? | Completion criteria met, artifact saved, validation passed |
| What risk remains? | Subjective judgment calls, missing context, or external dependency failures


## Artifact

Emit `WebappTestingArtifact` as both:
- JSON: `.agents/skills/platform/artifacts/webapp-testing/{identifier}.json`
- Markdown view: same filename with `.md` extension


# 
# 
# Webapp Testing

Use this skill when the project needs guidance on how to test a frontend or full-stack web app. The goal is to select the right seam and keep each test level honest about what it proves.


## Steps

1. Identify the public behavior that needs proof.
2. Map that behavior to the smallest useful seam.
3. Decide which level owns the check: unit, integration, or end-to-end.
4. Define the boundary so tests do not overreach into internals.

## Completion

- the skill's completion criteria are explicitly checked
- the artifact is saved and validated
- any blockers or skipped validations are documented
- the next consumer is identified or the work is handed off
