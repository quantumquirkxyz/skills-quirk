## Contract

- **Input:** problem or task defined by the skill body.
- **Output:** Markdown artifact or structured result with completion criteria met.
- **Side effects:** none (design/review/documentation only unless explicitly stated).
- **Dependencies:** none (self-contained unless linked to other skills).
- **Stop condition:** all process steps completed; artifact saved; criteria checked.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** produces reasoning or documentation artifacts; does not modify external systems unless explicitly instructed.


Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** — official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs — not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.

## Rules

- Rule: prefer primary sources and record why any secondary source was used.
- Rule: cite claim-level sources, not just a bibliography at the end.
- Rule: capture publication or access dates when freshness matters.
- Rule: separate confirmed facts, source interpretation, and open questions.
- Rule: preserve enough search/query detail for another agent to reproduce the research path.

## Completion Criteria

- research question and scope are explicit
- sources are primary or justified exceptions
- findings are saved to a Markdown artifact
- every material claim has traceable source evidence
