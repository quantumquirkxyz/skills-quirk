## Contract

- **Input:** physics subfield, authors, keywords, time window.
- **Output:** digest + optional BibTeX.
- **Side effects:** none.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Stop condition:** digest saved with groups and sources.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** monitors and summarises; makes no scientific claim.

# Physics Literature Search

Track the **front of physics** — arXiv, INSPIRE, NASA ADS, citation graphs — with explicit subfield filters and a relevance score.

## When to use

- The researcher needs to stay current in a subfield.
- A new project needs a literature survey.
- A paper needs a comparison with recent work.

## Process

### 1. Define the tracking set

- **Subfields** — arXiv categories (hep-th / cond-mat / astro-ph / quant-ph / gr-qc / nucl-th / physics.bio-ph, etc.).
- **Authors / institutions** — names to follow.
- **Keywords / methods** — terms for filtering (e.g. "superfluidity", "gravitational waves", "DFT").
- **Window** — since last digest (default 7 days).
- **Citation triggers** — papers that cite a tracked paper.

**Completion criterion:** set explicit; queries reproducible.

### 2. Pull from primary sources

- **arXiv** — daily RSS / API by category; filter with keywords.
- **INSPIRE-HEP** — for high-energy physics; citation graphs.
- **NASA ADS** — for astrophysics; journal links.
- **Web of Science / Crossref** — for journal versions and citation counts.
- **OpenAlex / Semantic Scholar** — for broader citation graphs.

Each item carries: title, authors, abstract, source, link, subfield, citation count.

**Completion criterion:** sources listed; items with full metadata.

### 3. Filter and score

Score 1–5:

- **5:** tracked author + tracked subfield + keyword match.
- **4:** two of three.
- **3:** neighbouring subfield or method.
- **2:** tangential.
- **1:** not relevant.

State the score reason.

**Completion criterion:** scores stated; reasons brief.

### 4. Group and deliver

Group by:

- Subfield (hep-th / cond-mat / astro-ph / quant-ph).
- Author / group.
- Method / technique.
- Milestone (e.g. "first observation of X", "resolution of open problem Y").

Deliver a Markdown digest with groups, abstract summaries, citation counts, and a **reading priority** (most relevant first).

**Completion criterion:** digest saved; priority stated; sources cited.
