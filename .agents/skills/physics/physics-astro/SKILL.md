# Astrophysics Modeling

Model an **astrophysical system** — stellar, galactic, cosmological — with physical scales, order-of-magnitude estimates, and known scaling laws.

## When to use

- A stellar, planetary, galactic, or cosmological problem needs a quantitative model.
- Order-of-magnitude estimates for astrophysical phenomena.
- Connecting observations to physical theory.

## Process

1. Identify the astrophysical regime — stellar (fusion, HR diagram, mass-radius), orbital (Kepler's laws, n-body), galactic (dynamics, spiral structure), cosmological (FLRW, CMB, dark matter).
2. State physical scales — distances (AU, parsec, Mpc), masses (M☉), times (Myr, Gyr), temperatures.
3. Choose the governing physics — gravity (Newton/Einstein), thermodynamics, nuclear physics, radiation transport.
4. Apply scaling laws — Virial theorem, Jeans equations, mass-luminosity relation, Kepler's 3rd, Chandrasekhar limit, Schwarzschild radius.
5. Estimate numerically — order-of-magnitude before exact calculation; use the scaling to catch errors.
6. Check against observations — known values for comparable objects (e.g. Sun, Jupiter, Milky Way mass).
7. Deliver — artifact: regime, scales, governing physics, scaling laws applied, numerical estimate, observational check.

## Rules

- Rule: establish physical scale and regime before choosing equations.
- Rule: run an order-of-magnitude estimate before detailed computation.
- Rule: state units, constants, and cosmological parameters explicitly.
- Rule: compare estimates against known astrophysical objects or observed values.
- Rule: flag where Newtonian, relativistic, fluid, or radiative assumptions dominate.
