# Physics Data Analysis — ROOT / Python

Analyse **experimental physics data** with reproducible scripts, explicit calibration, and a complete error budget.

## When to use

- Experimental data needs statistical analysis.
- A result needs a systematic error table.
- Data must be preserved with analysis linked.

## Process

### 1. Data loading and validation

- Load data (ROOT / HDF5 / CSV / binary); verify schema.
- Check for missing values, outliers, inconsistent units.
- Confirm file provenance (run number, detector state, date).

**Completion criterion:** data validated; provenance recorded.

### 2. Calibration

Apply:

- **Energy / momentum scale** — calibration from standard source.
- **Efficiency correction** — acceptance and reconstruction efficiency.
- **Background subtraction** — with statistical error.

Record the calibration constants with their uncertainties.

**Completion criterion:** calibration applied; constants with errors saved.

### 3. Statistical analysis

- **Histogram / fit** — with appropriate model (Gaussian, Poisson, exponential, custom).
- **Hypothesis test** — chi² / Kolmogorov-Smirnov / likelihood ratio.
- **Confidence interval** — 68% / 95% (bootstrap or analytic).
- **Systematic table** — each source (calibration, model, background, acceptance) with contribution.

**Completion criterion:** statistical result with error budget saved; systematic table present.

### 4. Results and plots

- **Plots:** data points + model / fit; systematic bands; labels with units.
- **Result summary:** value ± statistical ± systematic.
- **Reproducibility:** script saved; data file linked by DOI or path.

**Completion criterion:** plots saved; result summary present; script linked.

## Rules

- Rule: preserve raw data and write analysis outputs separately.
- Rule: record provenance, run conditions, calibration constants, and software environment.
- Rule: propagate statistical and systematic uncertainties separately.
- Rule: label plots with units, selections, and fit/model assumptions.
- Rule: make scripts reproducible from a clean checkout or documented environment.
