- **Stop condition:** entry complete; FAIR checklist filled.
- **Risk:** low.
- **Boundary:** produces documentation artifacts; no changes to equipment.

# Experimental Physics Notebook

Build an **experimental lab notebook** — structured, reproducible, FAIR-compliant — that another physicist could use to reproduce the measurement.

## When to use

- A measurement has been made.
- Data must be preserved for publication or collaboration.
- A reviewer asks for raw data or calibration details.

## Process

### 1. Experiment description

State:

- **Physical system** — apparatus, conditions (T, P, B, etc.), scale.
- **Measured quantity** — with units and expected magnitude.
- **Purpose** — hypothesis tested or parameter extracted.
- **References** — theory / prior measurement.

**Completion criterion:** all elements present.

### 2. Setup and calibration

Document:

- **Apparatus** — instruments with model numbers, settings.
- **Calibration procedure** — standard source, method, date, result.
- **Traceability** — chain to a national/international standard if applicable.
- **Calibration uncertainty** — propagated into the final result.

**Completion criterion:** calibration documented with traceability and uncertainty.

### 3. Measurements

Record:

- **Raw data** — time stamps, conditions, instrument readings.
- **Data format** — file format (CSV, HDF5, ROOT) with schema description.
- **Sampling rate / integration time** — with justification.
- **Environment conditions** — during measurement (temperature, humidity, magnetic field, vibration).

**Completion criterion:** raw data linked; format described.

### 4. Error analysis

Distinguish:

- **Statistical errors** — variance of repeated measurements.
- **Systematic errors** — calibration errors, instrument bias, environmental effects.
- **Combined uncertainty** — root-sum-square or full covariance matrix.
- **Sensitivity analysis** — how does the result change with key parameter perturbation?

**Completion criterion:** statistical and systematic errors quantified; combined uncertainty reported.

### 5. FAIR checklist

- **Findable** — metadata (title, authors, date, keywords) in a repository (Zenodo, OSF, institutional).
- **Accessible** — open access policy; file formats (CSV, HDF5) with open specifications.
- **Interoperable** — metadata uses standard vocabularies (e.g. Dublin Core, DataCite, FAIRsharing).
- **Reusable** — licence (CC0 / MIT), code for analysis linked, version control (Git tag / DOI).

**Completion criterion:** checklist filled; DOI or Git tag assigned.

### 6. Deliver

Markdown entry with: description, setup, calibration, measurements, error analysis, FAIR checklist, and linked data. The entry should be readable by another physicist without the original experimenter.

**Completion criterion:** entry saved; all links active; FAIR checklist complete.
