# Classical Mechanics

Solve a **classical mechanics** problem — Newton's laws, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, or orbital — with free-body analysis, energy accounting, and dimensional checks.

## When to use

- A mechanical system needs its motion solved (forces, trajectories, equilibrium).
- Engineering, robotics, aerospace, or sports analysis.
- Rigid body rotation, orbital mechanics, or vibrations.

## Process

1. Identify system — particles, rigid body, continuous; degrees of freedom.
2. Draw free-body diagram — all forces with direction, labels, and units.
3. Choose formulation — Newtonian (F=ma), Lagrangian (L=T−V), Hamiltonian (H=T+V), or energy methods.
4. Write equations — Newton's 2nd / Euler-Lagrange / Hamilton's equations; include constraints (holonomic / nonholonomic).
5. Solve — analytically (harmonic oscillator, projectile, central force) or numerically (RK4 for ODEs, finite elements).
6. Dimensional check — verify [force]=[mass][acceleration]; no hidden unit mismatches.
7. Physical limits — check limiting cases (small angle, large mass, friction → 0).
8. Deliver — artifact: diagram, formulation, equations, solution, dimensional check, and limiting cases.

## Rules

- Rule: define coordinate system, sign conventions, and constraints before writing equations.
- Rule: account for every force, torque, or generalized coordinate.
- Rule: check units and limiting cases after deriving the solution.
- Rule: state when approximations such as small angle, massless string, or frictionless contact are used.
- Rule: prefer conservation laws when they simplify the problem without hiding assumptions.
