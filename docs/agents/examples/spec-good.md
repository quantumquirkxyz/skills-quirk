# Example Spec

## Metadata

- Labels: `spec`, `ready-for-agent`
- Milestone: none
- Project: none
- Fields: `work_type` = Epic; `repo_scope` = app; `phase` = spec; `priority` = medium; `risk` = medium

## Problem Statement

Maintainers need a consistent way to turn incoming project requests into claimable work without losing scope boundaries or validation expectations.

## Goals

- Convert accepted requests into traceable work items.
- Preserve scope, validation, and ownership in the issue tracker.

## Non-goals

- Building a new issue tracker.

## Solution

Add a workflow that publishes a request as structured work with acceptance criteria, validation, and metadata.

## User Stories

1. As a maintainer, I want a request converted into structured work, so that an agent can implement it without reconstructing the conversation.

## Functional Requirements

- The artifact includes metadata, source, outcome, acceptance criteria, validation, and scope boundaries.

## Implementation Decisions

- The issue tracker remains the source of truth.
- The generated work item follows `docs/agents/work-item-format.md`.

## Testing Decisions

- Primary test seam: artifact validation.
- Required automated checks: scenario evaluator and semantic audit.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Published work has metadata aligned with the work-item format.
- [ ] Published work includes at least one validation check and keeps the linked metadata aligned.

## Out of Scope

- Automatic assignment.

## Risks and Open Questions

- Risk: project-specific vocabulary can leak into reusable templates; mitigation is semantic audit.
- Open question: None.
