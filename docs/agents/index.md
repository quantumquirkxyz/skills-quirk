# Agent Skills Index

This repo uses the repository-local quirk Skills bundle in `.agents/skills/`. This index is the operating map for the bundle and the first stop after `work-item-router` for any work-item or review flow.

## Work item flow

- `work-item-router` reads this index first before any spec, ticket, project board, or publication flow.
- `triage` uses the same index when classifying issues and PRs into durable states.
- `to-spec` and `to-tickets` use the issue tracker configuration and canonical work-item format documented here.
- `review-pr`, `plan-review-fixes`, `implement-review-fixes`, `publish-open-pr`, and `ship-subissue` preserve the same metadata contract.
- `ask-to` is the user-facing route selector after governance preflight. Use it when the next step is uncertain or the request is not already a claimed work item.
- If a PR branch is conflicted while review or repair is in progress, branch-state resolution belongs to `resolving-merge-conflicts` before review or shipping resumes.
