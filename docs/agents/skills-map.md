## Core flow

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ask-to` | Route to the right next step |
| `grill` / `grilling` / `grill-me` / `grill-with-docs` | Sharpen plans through interview |
| `project-development` | Evaluate project shape and starting point |
| `context-pack` | Build a minimal fresh context pack |
| `work-item-router` | Force reading the governance index before routing |
| `domain-modeling` | Build and sharpen domain model |
| `codebase-design` | Design deep modules and seams |
| `to-spec` | Turn conversation into a published spec |
| `to-tickets` | Break plan into tracer-bullet tickets |
| `implement` | Implement work from spec or tickets |
| `publish-open-pr` | Open a PR from an issue branch |
| `review-pr` | Review PR against Standards and Spec axes |
| `review-fix-loop` | Orchestrate review-repair loop |
| `plan-review-fixes` | Convert review findings into a remediation plan |
| `implement-review-fixes` | Apply the planned review fixes |
| `ship-subissue` | Merge clean PR and close linked issue |

Canonical route: `setup-quirk-skills` once per repo, then `ask-to` when routing is unclear. For standard feature work, use `grill-with-docs` -> `to-spec` -> `to-tickets` -> `implement` -> `publish-open-pr` -> `review-pr`. If the review is dirty, `review-fix-loop` coordinates `plan-review-fixes` and `implement-review-fixes` until the PR is clean or blocked. `ship-subissue` owns merge, issue closure, and tracker completion only after a clean review.

## Quality and governance

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AUTHORSHIP.md` | Authorship and integrity rules |
| `docs/agents/quirk-method.md` | Method vocabulary and quality bar |
| `docs/agents/provenance.md` | Origin and redesign status |
| `skill-audit` | Audit bundle, lockfile, symlink parity |
| `evaluate-skill` | Evaluate skill against fixed scenarios |
| `knowledge-curator` | Keep context and ADRs coherent |
| `writing-great-skills` | Vocabulary and principles for skills |
| `execution-policy` | Decide whether a skill action is allowed |
| `docs-management` | Keep docs aligned with project shape |
| `triage` | Classify issues and PRs into durable states |
| `make-project` | Create and configure GitHub Projects |
| `setup-quirk-skills` | Configure repo for quirk workflows |
