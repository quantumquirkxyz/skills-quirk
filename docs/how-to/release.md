- [ ] Update `../reference/agents/skills-map.md` if routing changed.
- [ ] Add or update scenarios for workflow changes.
- [ ] Add or update behavioral fixtures for artifact-template changes.
- [ ] Run `node .agents/skills/platform/check-all.mjs`.

## Release

- [ ] Commit only scoped release files.
- [ ] Tag as `v<version>`.
- [ ] Push branch and tag.
- [ ] Publish release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
